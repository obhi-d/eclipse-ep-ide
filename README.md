Eclipse IDE Enhancement

The plugin will add IDE Enhancements in a new 'view' called 'Navigable View'. 
This view will list all default resources available to the Common Navigator.
Current feature will add a filter to the View allowing filtering the list of resources by name.
The plugin is applicable to any Extension or Perspective that uses CNF.

The plugin can be directly installed from Eclipse Marketplace:
